# subnet-calculator-demo

This is a mini-app that helps you calculate the number of subnets you can create in a CIDR block.

I created this because I needed to work out how many equal-sized subnets I could create in a CIDR block, and thought it was a good opportunity to learn some JS.

Developed with Svelte.

Created with:

```
npm create vite@latest
```

## Running locally

```bash
cd app/

npm install
npm run dev -- open
```
